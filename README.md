# Scene Recognition Task

## Instructions for running the code

### Install the Python environment

1. Update Anaconda Navigator (or conda if you want to use the Terminal).
2. Save locally the computer_vision.yaml file, it contains the conda environment necessary for running the code.
3. Open the Anaconda Navigator application.
4. Click the "Import" button at the bottom of the list with your environments. This will install the environment with all required Python packages to your machine.
5. Once the environment is installed, it can be used to run the code.

### Run the code
1. Download the zip file with code inside.
2. The downloaded code will have 3 folders inside: "Run 1", "Run 2" and "Run 3".
3. Place the images dataset in the parent directory of the folder "Run X". For instance, if you want to execute run 1, place the images dataset in the parent directory that has "Run 1" folder inside. Call the dataset folders as "training" and "testing". You can then execute all other runs with the same dataset.
4. Run the code through the installed environment (as described in the "Install the Python environment" section).
